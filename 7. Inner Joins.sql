#SQL INNER JOIN â€“ querying data from three tables
SELECT 
    productID,
    productName,
    categoryName,
    companyName AS supplier
FROM
    products
INNER JOIN
    categories ON categories.categoryID = products.categoryID
INNER JOIN
    suppliers ON suppliers.supplierID = products.supplierID


/*Questions 1-4: How many unique dog_guids and user_guids
are there in the reviews and dogs table independently?*/


/*Try the inner join query once with just the dog_guid or
once with just the user_guid clause in the WHERE statement:*/

/*Question 5: How would you extract the user_guid, dog_guid,
breed, breed_type, and breed_group for all animals who completed 
the "Yawn Warm-up" game (you should get 20,845 rows if you
join on dog_guid only)?*/
